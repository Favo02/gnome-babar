  "description": "Task bar. App grid & favorites & workspaces & tasks in panel. Light extension.\n\n Replace 'Activities' button by all current workspaces and apps buttons. Switch workspace/app or toggle overview by clicking on these buttons. Drag and drop favorite, task, dash item or app grid item to any workspace (you cannot reorder tasks inside a workspace). Persistent window preview with right-click (right-click again to close it). Change 'Places' label to an icon. Settings in preferences UI.\n\n You can use names for workspaces: there are two ways for that. 1) Edit the string array 'org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.workspace-names' gsettings key (through dconf editor, e.g.). 2) Use official GNOME extension Workspaces Indicator's settings. You don't have to write a long enough list: numbers are displayed if no workspace name is defined.\n\n Changelog: https://github.com/fthx/babar/issues/2",
